### Welcome!👋
Just a Full Stack Developer Turning Ideas into Scalable Web Apps with Modern Tech 💻

I'm a passionate and results-driven developer from Colombia, blending creativity with code to build web applications that are clean, functional, and user-focused. By day, I work as a BTS Support and Customer Care Specialist, where I solve technical problems and support clients with precision and empathy. By night (and any spare moment), I dive deep into full stack development.

I work confidently with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) and I’m comfortable crafting both frontend and backend logic. I love using TypeScript for safer, scalable code and Tailwind CSS for building elegant, responsive UIs efficiently.

🛠 Tech I Use Daily:

Languages: JavaScript, TypeScript, Python

Frontend: React, Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap 5

Backend: Node.js, Express.js

Database: MongoDB

Tools: Postman, VS Code, Git/GitHub, NPM

Extras: Advanced Excel, Power Automate, REST APIs

I’m all about learning by doing, which is why my GitHub is packed with projects that reflect my growth and adaptability. I take pride in writing clean, maintainable code and bringing value to every project I touch—especially in startup, freelance, or indie environments where impact matters.

If you're looking for someone who can build, learn fast, and adapt to any challenge, I’d love to connect. Let’s build something amazing!

⚡ Fun fact: I have a lot of experience with English language, because I worked as a Customer Service Rep for almost 3 years to companies like Target, Walmart, Comcast and Affirm.
